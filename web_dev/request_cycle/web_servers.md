#### What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
  * It never assumes the user is incompetent, therefore it gives the user a large amount of power.
  * It treats everyone equally and allows everyone to achieve the same maximum amount of power.
  * The ease with which the user can open a VM to access a linux based command line and the power that comes with it.
  * *Treat all users with respect*
    * This means allowing each user to do things their own way in any way they choose. It means freedom, and flexibility.
