#### What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
  * It never assumes the user is incompetent, therefore it gives the user a large amount of power.
  * It treats everyone equally and allows everyone to achieve the same maximum amount of power.
  * The ease with which the user can open a VM to access a linux based command line and the power that comes with it.
  * *Treat all users with respect*
    * This means allowing each user to do things their own way in any way they choose. It means freedom, and flexibility.

  #### In your own words, what is a VPS? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
  * A VPS is a virtualized server that mimics a regular server  within a designated space of a dedicated server.
    * Example Advantages:
      * A VPS will only cost a fraction of the price of a server.
      * Can be upgraded on the spot which increases its scalability.
      * Easily manage your VPS with a control panel on the internet.
      * Freely choose any operating system to use.

 ####  Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
 * Similarly to why you would not work on a master branch, it is considered best practice and defeats the purpose of Linux's security. Running as root would mean you're using the highest level of administrative privilege thus making the system highly vulnerable to the point that if you were to create a bug, got a virus, or experience a crash it could permanently affect the entire system. Leaving applications to be run on a user level prevents these issues from happening.
