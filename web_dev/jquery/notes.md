### Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in 2 hours.

#### My Plan
  * Begin by pre-reading/skimming the jQuery section in my Jon Duckett book on javascript and jQuery. (10 minutes)
  * Spend 30 minutes reading as many pages as possible, flagging pages that will be good as a reference.
  * After that 30 minutes is up, practice what i've learned so far (without any internet help) for 25 minutes
  * Take a 15 minute break
  * Spend 20 minutes researching questions formed after reading the book, using google and stack overflow
  * Spend 10 minutes refactoring/filling any holes of my first practice attempt.
  * Final 10 minutes: Clean up using good git workflow and push to github.

  ###### Note: My plan was organized based off of my learning style and what has worked when learning other rabbit hole concepts as well

#### Reflection
  * I ended up finding a lot of good online resources but I ultimately ended up in a rabbit hole! (Need to work on time boxing better).
  * I spent a lot of time researching and a lot of time trying to just do simple tasks until I finally got the hang of certain concepts (even though they were pretty basic).
  * I think my plan in generally went really well! I found great clarification in my book and good references online.
  * Most effective strategy for me was instead of researching for a certain amount of time and then practicing, doing both at the same time helped much more in the long run!
