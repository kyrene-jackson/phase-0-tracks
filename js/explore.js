// In comments, pseudocode a function that takes a string as a parameter and reverses the string. reverse("hello"), for
// example, should return "olleh". This isn't a task specific to JavaScript -- your pseudocode should be in plain English // and use phrases like "for each" instead of JavaScript-specific terms. Remember that you can add strings in JavaScript, // so '' + 'a' would result in the string 'a'. Take your time. This is the most valuable skill in programming: being able // to think through a problem logically.

// Create a reverse method that takes a string as a perameter.
// User inputs a string. Example: "hello".
// Assign user input to variable.
// Assign empty string to a variable. Example: a = " ";
// Determine the number of letters in input string.
// For each number in the count greater than 0,
// print a single letter from the string begining from the end.
// Add variable set to empty string to each letter.
// Once counter is greater than or equal to 0,
// Print the complete string.
