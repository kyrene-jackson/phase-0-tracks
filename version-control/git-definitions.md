# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  Version control allows us to view the full history of revisions made to one or more files as well as merge revisions made by different people. This is useful because if a mistake is made, you can always roll back.


* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  A branch is a personal copy of a main project for you to work on. This can be used to safely add, or experiment with features while keeping the master file working perfectly.


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  A commit is a save point created manually using the command line. A good commit message is detailed and explains what was changed since the previous commit.


* What is a merge conflict?
  A merge conflict can occur when two people edit and submit different versions of the same file.
