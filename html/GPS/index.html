Kyrene Jackson Reflection:
-The purpose of HTML5 smenatic tags is to add a deeper meaning to elements for both the browser and for someone looking at your code.
I find the table, section, header, and footer tags to be most useful.

-The browser displays the elements on a page in order of their semantic meaning.

-I use atom as a text editor instead of sublime so I didn't get a chance to test out snippets on my end. I know that atom does use snippets though so I will take some time today to learn how to implement them. Working with my partner who used snippets in sublime defenitely makes me feel like they will be of great use.

-I think implementing some of the semantic elements was challenging especially because their descriptions were often very similar (for example the section and article elements). I think semantic elements are harder to learn because many of them do not present any visual changes. I found it helpful to look them up in w3 schools and simply test them out while asking my partner and guide for clarification.
